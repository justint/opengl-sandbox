# opengl-sandbox
My personal sandbox for C++ OpenGL experimentation. Proceed with caution.

At the time of my writing (November 25, 2015), I am currently following the OGLdev Modern OpenGL Tutorials, which can be found here:
http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/

I am using *freeGLUT (The OpenGL Utility Toolkit)* and *GLEW (OpenGL Extention Wrangler Library)* for my work; the DLLs are included in the project, but to fully implement the two libraries their .lib files are also necessary. Please consult their respective websites (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/, http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for more information.
